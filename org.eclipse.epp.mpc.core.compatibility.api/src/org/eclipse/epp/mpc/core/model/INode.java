/**
 * A node represents an entry on a marketplace. It is associated with one or more categories, under which it is listed.
 * Additionally, tags can be specified to define related technologies.
 * <p>
 * A node contains all information about a marketplace entry necessary to present it to users, including a
 * {@link #getName()}, {@link #getOwner() owner}, {@link #getShortdescription() short} and {@link #getBody() long}
 * description, {@link #getImage() icon} and optional {@link #getScreenshot()}. Some social feedback on the node entry
 * is provided by means of its {@link #getInstallsTotal() total} and {@link #getInstallsRecent() recent} installation
 * counts, as well as the number of {@link #getFavorited() favorite votes} it has received.
 * <p>
 * Nodes can describe different kinds of {@link #getType() contributions}, like installable Eclipse plug-ins, consulting
 * services and so on. In case of installable Eclipse plug-ins, the {@link #getIus() installable units} are provided for
 * installation from the node's {@link #getUpdateurl() update site}.
